# Design: POS Spec Refinements
**Status: Ready for Review**

## Approach
Two new bullets are appended to the existing guidance list in `POS.md`. No
existing content is modified. The `pathlib` bullet is a natural companion to the
existing `pathlib` mention in the suggested libraries list; the `atexit` bullet
stands alone. Both are added to the pre-approved built-ins list (`atexit`).

## Tasks
1. ~~Add `Path.open()` preference bullet to `POS.md`~~
2. ~~Add `atexit` cleanup bullet to `POS.md`, and add `atexit` to the suggested built-ins list~~
3. ~~Confirm implementation complete and ready to archive~~
